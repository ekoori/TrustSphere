# TrustSphere

## Introduction

TrustSphere is a decentralized, social platform designed to foster stronger connections within communities. It's built on the principles of the gift economy and liquid democracy. The goal of TrustSphere is to empower individuals and communities to share resources and make collective decisions in a transparent and engaged manner.

Our purpose is to redefine how we engage with the economy and democracy. TrustSphere seeks to promote an alternative to money-driven society, a culture of giving, where goods and services are given without a need for any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. By incorporating liquid democracy, we aim to make decision-making more accessible and representative.
